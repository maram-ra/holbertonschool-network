Notes:
- DNS resolves domain name into server IP.
- Firewall filters traffic, only HTTPS (port 443) allowed.
- TLS/SSL ensures encrypted traffic.
- Load balancer distributes requests across multiple servers.
- Web servers serve static files and forward to app servers.
- Application servers generate dynamic pages.
- Database stores and provides data for the application.
